    # LD pruning options: Required for all types of analysis

    # clump_kb Maximum distance for pruning.

    # R options: required for all types of analysis
    # Specifies options for how nuisance correlation is estimated.
    # Type can be either "ldsc", "pt", or "none". LDSC or pt will both work. pt is faster and generally gives nearly identical results to LDSC.
    # if type includes "pt", pthresh must be specified.
    # l2_dir is required if type includes "ldsc". This is the directory containing LD-scores

    # GFA options:
    #   The GFA pipeline will run GFA on all of the tratits in the csv.
    #       It will also compute the GLS weights for all SNPs that have complete data and compute the genetic correlation of the factors.
    #   gfa_params: If "default", will use default parameters, otherwise provide a .RDS file containing a prameter list eg "list(max_iter = 500)".
    #   max_snps: largest number of variants to allow
    #   maxrep: If algorithm does not converge in maxiter iterations, the pipeline will try again this number of times. This allows restarting of non-converged fits.
    #   gfa_seed: Seed for GFA. This can be a list, in which case multiple fits will be done using different seeds.
    #   af_thresh: allele frequency threshold
    #   sample_size_tol: Tolerance for sample size variability around the median sample size per trait. Let M_t be the median sample size for trait t. If
    #              the sample size for SNP j in trait t is N_{j,t}, SNP j will be excluded unless (1-sample_size_tol)*M_t <= N_{j,t} <= (1 + sample_size_tol)*M_t
    #   The cor_clust option is useful when analyzing highly correlated traits from overlapping samples. Traits will be clustered greedily and a
    #         representative trait selected so that no pair of traits have nuisance correlation greater than the vlaue specified. If you don't
    #         need to perform clustering, just set cor_clust to 1.
